# TO DO

## Block Shifter

Summary:
Metrodvania/Puzzle style there I unlock passages by activating buttons that moves walls (rectangles) up, down, left or right

Feeling:
- It should feel good to move around the map. Nice controls and jump
- not a typical platform. you can only jump and double jump (later on the game)
- focus is a puzzle but the whole map is a puzzle. move walls and validate if a wall can be moveable. example: maybe a wall is blocked by another wall. Use mset/mget for collision detection and also store x,y,type in a array to keep track when activating/deactivating buttons

Controls:

- Left/right to move
- x to jump
- x in the air to double jump (unlock later on the game)
- o to interact with enviroment, activate button
