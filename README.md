# Hobby-Game-Development

## I created my own Game Engine in C#

- Sprite Editor. You can draw your 32x32 pixel art
- Map Editor. You can create your TileMap using the pixel art you just made using multiple layers.
- Song Editor. You can create your own songs and play in the game
- Collor Palette Settings. You can choose a different color palette which will affect the whole Game Engine including your game
- Game screen. You can play your game based on the assets you've just created
- Lua Script. You can use your favorite code text editor to create your logic using the Lua programming language.
- You can manage your list of games. Load/Save your projects.
- Game functions. Don't reinvent the wheel. The Game engine already provides some functions: draw map, assets and etc, play your music, define camera (grid or follow object type), get player input, collision detection and more.
- Reusable UIComponent c# class for all buttons in the Game Engine. It draws 2d Texture, detects MouseOver and MouseClicked.

This is an unfinished project. It is just a hobby and it is taking too much time of my weekends ðŸ˜¬ 

I used only:
1 - Monogame framework: https://monogame.net/
2 - Nlua - https://github.com/NLua/NLua
